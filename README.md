### Welcome ! Happy you find me ðŸ˜‰

### Are you wondering who am I ?
I'm Audrey, a French student in Electronic, Computer and Telecommunications Engineering at CPE LYON. And this is my serious github account, you know the one I can show without shame. Well, almost shamelessly ... So, today, I am in my second year of engineering, happy of learning many interresting things like :
  - the archichecture of operationnal amplifier like this amazing current mirror in analog electronic.
  - the beauty of a microcontroller
  - program an FPGA with style
  - use several processes in python with delicacy
  - de-noise a signal to hear the wonderful voice of my teacher
  - and many others ...

### What will you find when scrolling through my github pages?

You won't find the Holy Grail, sorry, but just some projects I made at school or on my own time. But still, I hope you will enjoy discovering them.

### What do I want to do in the future after school ?

I wanted to become an engineer because my father, an engineer, told me: An engineer learns to learn and then he learns by himself the rest of his life. And as far as my working life is concerned, I am afraid of one thing: being bored. However, someone who is always learning something new, how could he be bored? He can't. So I am going to become an engineer. Perhaps now you are wondering why I chose digital sciences? What would you choose between these answers? 
  - because I was found of coding
  - because this a sector who hired many people 
  - because my father work in this field
  - because there is many progress and evolution in this field
  - because I loved dismantle old electronic devices to see how they worked
 
I was never a tinkerer when I was a kid, I wasn't really interested in anything digital, even though my father used to talk to me about it a lot because it was his field of work. I spent my days reading and daydreaming. I never wrote a single computer program until I entered my first year of preparatory school, my first year of university. I chose this field because it evolves enormously, it allows a lot of innovation, novelty and therefore for me it is synonymous with creativity and also the fact that I could never be bored.
So after school, when I graduate, I want to work in research and development in electronics and embedded systems because at school, that's what I find most complex, and I like complexity because you don't get bored so quickly... I want to be part of innovation, I want to make the world a better place and I hope I will never be bored in my job.
